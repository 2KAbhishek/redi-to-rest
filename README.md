<h3>REST API with Redis üì≠üçé</h3>

</div>

## What is this

A REST API built with Node to demonstrate Redis persistence.

## Inspiration

Was learning about redis persistence, wanted to try it out.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed the latest version of `node and redis`

## Getting redi-to-rest

To get redi-to-rest, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/2kabhishek/redi-to-rest
cd redi-to-rest
```

## Using redi-to-rest

```bash
cp .env.example .env
$EDITOR .env #Set the REDIS_URL env to your redis instance
npm start
```

## How it was built

redi-to-rest was built using `neovim, node, redis`

### How the data is stored:

Refer to [this example](https://github.com/redis-developer/basic-analytics-dashboard-redis-bitmaps-nodejs#how-the-data-is-stored) for a more detailed example of what you need for this section.

### How the data is accessed:

Refer to [this example](https://github.com/redis-developer/basic-analytics-dashboard-redis-bitmaps-nodejs#how-the-data-is-accessed) for a more detailed example of what you need for this section.

### Performance Benchmarks

[If you migrated an existing app to use Redis, please put performance benchmarks here to show the performance improvements.]

## How to run it locally?

[Make sure you test this with a fresh clone of your repo, these instructions will be used to judge your app.]

### Prerequisites

[Fill out with any prerequisites (e.g. Node, Docker, etc.). Specify minimum versions]

### Local installation

[Insert instructions for local installation]

## Deployment
